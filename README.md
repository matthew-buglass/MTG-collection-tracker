# AI Magic The Gathering (MTG) Collection Manager

Magic The Gathering (MTG) is the oldest and most complex trading card game. In addition to being able to play the game in multiple formats, 
tournaments, and pro tours, MTG cards also serve as collectables. As such each card has a value based on it's age, rarity, legal formats that it can
be played in, and general use in the game.

As MTG formats usually use decks of 60, 100, or in limited formats such as Cube up to 720 cards, collections can grow quickly. This application will
assist users to manage their card collections, using AI image recognition in conjunction with calls to [Scryfall's](https://scryfall.com/) REST API to catalogue 
cards, track their location in a user's collection, and the value of a user's collection and decks.
